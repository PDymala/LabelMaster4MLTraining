# LabelMaster4MLTraining

Following application is a part of Label Master 4 package. It's purpose is to train machine learning model based on a database created by crypto module. 
 It's a separate application because it has to use old version of WEKA 3.4.1. That is the only version available on Android and both, model and verification app has to have the same version.
 While crypto uses newest one for convenience purpose.
